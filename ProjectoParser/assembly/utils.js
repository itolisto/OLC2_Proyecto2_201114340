/*
This function iterates over a string to save each character inside an array,
each element of this array is intended to be stored in an address in memory 
for assmebly language of 32bits RISCV. In this architecture by default each address 
has four slots, each slot is 1byte/8bits that means each address in memory is 32 bits.
Strings are store in the heap, which is just a way to manage memory. All this is
the whole reason why we do a shift left on each 8 bits, this is done so we can
represent the string the way it is originally, to do that we first need to
bet the unicode value of each character, unkcode is basically a numeric representation
of a character
